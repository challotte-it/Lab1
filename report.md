I created a GitHub repository named Lab1 
I cloned the repository from GitHub to the local machine and navigated into the project directory

i created the index.html file where i copied and pasted what was on the lab assesment page. 
 After setting up the file, i made my first commit to Git, which stated that I'm 19 yrs old because the compiler said i can't commit that message unless i make a change. i know that's not the best commit message for creating a file but i wanted to say that

then i created the other file called student-info.txt which has my name and student number only. i think the commit for this one was appropriate

then i created this file right here, then i committed a message saying that i've created this file. 

then i went to create the branch i was asked in number 3.
