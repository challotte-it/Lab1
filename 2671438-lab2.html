        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! i'm Emihle Challotte Booi, a black premium doll from the Mother City. I'm currently 19 years old about to conquer the very last end of the wits undergrad edge.
            My favourite colour is <i style="color: purple;"> purple</i> and my favourite song is <i>Love on the Brain</i> by Rihanna.

        <h3>Latest Project</h3>
        <p> I recently worked on the <b>Donor Dash</b> project, where the goal was to make sure the homeless never go to bed hungry. The idea? Rescue all that leftover food from students that would otherwise end up in the trash, and deliver it straight to those who need it. I was all pumped up to get it up and running in just a month... but, well, let's just say I underestimated the challenge! It didn’t exactly go according to plan—but hey, I learned a ton along the way!
